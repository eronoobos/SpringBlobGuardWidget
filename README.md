Blob Guard Widget for Spring RTS
=====================

Widget to allow guarding multiple units. Guards repair and assist construction as needed to any unit within the assigned blob of targets. Combat units that are fast enough surround the blob in a circle to protect it.

To install, copy cmd\_blob\_guard.lua to ~/.config/spring/LuaUI/Widgets/ (linux) or Documents\my games\Spring\LuaUI\Widgets\ (windows)
